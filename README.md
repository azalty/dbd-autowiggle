# dbd-autowiggle
It's an AutoWiggle script for Dead by Daylight.
This is allowed and legit, legal. You will **NOT** be banned for that. (devs and EAC said they won't ban you for that)

### How to install

Just go to the releases (https://github.com/rlevet/dbd-autowiggle/releases) and download the last .exe (or the one that is working).
Just run it and follow instructions.

### Is it safe?

**Yes.** I tested it the 04/07/2019 (Day/Month/Year format) and it was working and safe.
EasyAntiCheat didn't block it and it worked.

Last working and safe version : **1.0.4**

### How does it work?

The script spam A and D for the WASD version or Q and D for the ZQSD version.
The script is under a timer to make that it will not exceed human's speed. We also use a human like script (we do what a human will do).

**Just press "F" and it will do it. Release the button to stop.**

### It doesn't work, help me!

Post in Issues (https://github.com/rlevet/dbd-autowiggle/issues) and I will change a little the script for you.
Also, be sure to check old releases to see if any is working for you.

### What do I need to have?

Nothing more is required. You only need to have Windows 7 or + and a keyboard that have the "F" and "F10" buttons.
